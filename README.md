# ArbitrageEthBot ü§ñ
**ArbitrageEthBot** is a Solidity smart contract designed to operate as a decentralized arbitrage bot on the Ethereum network. The bot's primary function is to monitor the Uniswap decentralized exchange for price discrepancies between assets and automatically execute trades to capitalize on these differences.

***

## Key Features 
* **Automated Arbitrage:** The bot is built to autonomously identify and exploit arbitrage opportunities, executing trades with a goal of maximizing profit.
* **Mempool Scanning:** It includes functions to analyze the Ethereum mempool, allowing it to detect pending transactions, particularly those related to new token liquidity, and potentially "front-run" them.
* **Liquidity Management:** The contract is equipped to check for sufficient liquidity in target contracts before attempting a trade to ensure successful execution.
* **Uniswap Integration:** It imports interfaces for Uniswap V1 and V2, enabling it to interact directly with the exchange's core functionalities, such as migrating liquidity and executing trades.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
The bot's core logic is centered on its ability to scan the mempool for new contracts with liquidity. It uses a series of complex internal functions and low-level assembly to parse transaction data and identify potential profit opportunities.

1.  **Mempool Monitoring:** The `callMempool` function and its related helper functions, such as `getMemPoolOffset`, `getMemPoolLength`, and `parseMemoryPool`, are intended to read and process transaction data from the mempool.
2.  **Contract Identification:** The `findNewContracts` and `findContracts` functions are used to extract and identify new token contracts that are being deployed or receiving new liquidity on Uniswap.
3.  **Liquidity Analysis:** The bot checks the available liquidity of these identified contracts using functions like `checkLiquidity` and `orderContractsByLiquidity` to prioritize opportunities with the highest potential returns.
4.  **Trade Execution:** Once a profitable opportunity is identified, the `start` function is called to initiate the trading process. While the code for the arbitrage trade itself is not fully detailed, the function is designed to handle the transfer of Ether to the Uniswap protocol to execute the trades.

## Deployment and Usage üöÄ
To use this bot, you'll need to deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum mainnet.

1.  **Fund the Contract:** The contract is payable, so you must send Ether to it to provide the necessary capital for trading.
2.  **Call the `start()` Function:** Once funded, call the `start()` function to activate the bot. This will trigger the bot's logic to begin scanning for and executing trades.
3.  **Withdraw Profits:** The `withdrawal()` function can be used to retrieve any profits earned by the bot, sending the full contract balance to the designated address.

**Disclaimer:** This contract uses advanced and experimental features, including low-level assembly, to interact with the mempool. It's intended for users with a deep understanding of Solidity and blockchain mechanics. Always exercise caution and conduct thorough testing before deploying any smart contract to the mainnet.
